Under construction.

This directory containes teh Angular front-end for the web-app Investment Journal.

User can input their positions for different stocks and the rationale behind their purchase.

The website can then be used as some sort of watchlist to track their current positions by looking at the live data.
They can also look back to their rationale of their purchase to see if things went as they thought it would.

This provides good discipline for the investor to make sure they can back up every position their hold, and consider the pros and cons for every purchase they make.

The back-end (also under construction) is written in Spring, and can be found here:
